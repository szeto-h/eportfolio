                <p class="col-12">During the past year of studies, I learned <strong>Python</strong> and
                    <strong>C++</strong>, gaining experience with both languages. Using these skills, I developed a
                    Caesar Cipher program in each language that enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages. Both
                    programs allow for user input and customization of shift values and directions. These projects
                    demonstrate my foundational understanding of programming concepts and my ability to apply them
                    effectively in two distinct programming environments.

            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5">Unlike C++, Python does not use the ASCII table to interchange
                characters, such as letters, with numbers. For this Caesar Cipher project, the alphabet was stored in a
                list, and simple if-else statements were used to shift letters based on their index. In contrast, C++
                required more complex mathematical formulas to shift characters correctly in the desired direction.
                While the use of ASCII tables offers benefits, it can also add complexity to the programming process,
                presenting a challenging but valuable learning experience for me. To ensure I was able to meet the
                deadline, I first finished coding the functions that I was confident about. Then I drafted out the
                functions I was less sure of, writing down the logic on paper to check if it made sense. To continuously
                test the program, I used various print or cout statements to check if the logic was accurate. With
                multiple trials, errors, and guidance from Instructional Assistants, I was able to refine my formula and
                achieve the desired outcome.

            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-9 col-lg-8">As part of my <strong>C++</strong> learning journey, I had the
                opportunity to create a
                library of functions that can be used to generate different pieces of art using C-strings and the ASCII
                table. Now that I have learned and practiced using the ASCII table, the new challenge is to use it to
                print out different shapes, such as circles, triangles, and rectangles. With these shapes, I can then
                use various functions to move them around the canvas to create a piece of 2D art. Following some example
                functions that my instructor had so kindly provided us in the starter code, I was able to formulate the
                functions for different shapes. Through research, trial and error, and the help of Instructional
                Assistants, I was able to complete the library of functions necessary to print out the shapes.</p>
