            <p class="col-12"><strong>Accessibility & Color. </strong> As we progress through the course, we continue to
                explore different
                strategies and methods of web design. Similar to previous assignments, I selected
                colors that can maximize contrast and enhance readability. The color purple was chosen as it is my
                favorite and I felt it would be the perfect representation for a portfolio about me. By using darker
                shades of purple as the background for white text, I achieved higher contrast. Lighter shades of purple
                are used to indicate the current tab the user is on and highlight links when the user hovers over them.
                A "Skip navigation" feature was implemented on each page, allowing users to tab directly to the
                main content for improved accessibility.</p>

        <div class="row two p-3">
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-7"><strong>Bootstrap. </strong> For this ePortfolio, I chose to use the
                newly learned Bootstrap framework to design the website. Through research and practice from previous
                labs, I have developed the skills to effectively use Bootstrap to align content, such as text and images,
                and achieve the desired layout. With a focus on responsive web design, I utilized Bootstrap
                to ensure that the content adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes. Reflecting on my first web
                project, I implemented a hamburger menu for smaller screens to improve content spacing and
                accessibility. Additionally, I included dropdown menus for navigating to different sections of the
                webpage, making access more user-friendly.</p>

        <div class="row three p-3">
            <p class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"><strong>The Challenge.</strong> Because I had only recently learned
                Bootstrap, I recognize
                that my experience with this framework is still limited. As a result, there may be alternative design
                and coding choices that could improve the overall project. To achieve the desired design and layout
                required extensive research and learning in the limited time, which helped me grow as a web developer.

            <p class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"><strong>Some Thoughts.</strong> As mentioned in The Challenge, limited
                knowledge can influence the design of this website. However, I believe I have made significant
                improvements since the last project. From a design perspective, I have enhanced accessibility and
                improved responsiveness. While learning Bootstrap within a short time frame was challenging, I find it
                more enjoyable and efficient for web design. As I worked on this webpage, I appreciated exploring
                alternative methods for creating diverse layouts, which made the process both rewarding and educational.
